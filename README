This repository is for a project called Really Big Clock
It was meant to provide an easier way for me to "see" if I could continue sleeping or if I would be better of getting up.
The plan is to have the digital clockface change its color related to the sleepime remaining.

Hardwarebasis currently is the AVR_NetIO board sold by the germany based company www.pollin.de
But since the project is Arduino based it can easily be adopted to every arduino board available.
